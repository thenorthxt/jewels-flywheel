# Jewels

Jewels don’t sit still — they shine.

A meme-native flywheel experiment where narrative and mechanics reinforce each other:
fees → self-marketing → buybacks → momentum.

No roadmap.
No promises.
Just a public repo for builders and believers.

## What is Jewels?

Jewels is a community-first memecoin-style experiment focused on one idea:

**Visibility is liquidity.**
If a token can market itself, it can keep shining.

This repo is a home for:
- simulations & dashboards
- token mechanic drafts
- community tooling
- narrative primitives

## The Flywheel

Jewels aims to model a simple loop:

1) Fees generate a budget  
2) Budget funds exposure (distribution, content, listings, tools)  
3) Exposure drives attention  
4) Attention drives demand  
5) Demand reinforces buy pressure (optional buybacks)  
6) Momentum increases visibility again

Jewels don’t pump.
They compound shine.
